*This is our project for COMP-3020.*

**We have data for limited books as the main functionality is to show how the application will work**
**The login page was ineffective as the database with different username and their data was hard to manage.**

***The HarryPotter.html is a sample for how the book details page would look, we weren't able to implement it for all the books and the "url" attribute crashed the whole site***
